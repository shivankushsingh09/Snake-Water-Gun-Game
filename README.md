## Introduction

Snake, Water, Gun" is a simple yet engaging command-line game developed in C programming language. The game pits the player against the computer in a series of rounds. Each round, the player chooses between 'Snake', 'Water', or 'Gun', and the computer randomly selects one as well. The outcome of each round is determined by specific rules: Snake wins against Water (as it can drink it), Water wins against Gun (by drowning it), and Gun wins against Snake (by shooting it). The game continues for a specified number of rounds, and the winner is determined by counting who wins more rounds.

This project enhances programming skills by implementing basic logic, user input handling, random number generation, and simple conditional statements in C.
